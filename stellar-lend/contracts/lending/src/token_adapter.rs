//! # Token Adapter Interface
//!
//! Provides standardized adapters for different token implementations,
//! enabling support for various token standards without core logic changes.
//!
//! ## Adapter Types
//! - **ERC20Adapter**: For standard ERC-20 compatible tokens
//! - **NativeAdapter**: For native blockchain assets (XLM)
//! - **WrappedAdapter**: For wrapped assets (e.g., Stellar's wrapped XLM)
